/*
The shortest path problem can be defined for graphs whether undirected, directed, or mixed. 
It is defined here for undirected graphs; for directed graphs the definition of path requires 
that consecutive vertices be connected by an appropriate directed edge.

Two vertices are adjacent when they are both incident to a common edge.

The problem is also sometimes called the single-pair shortest path problem, to distinguish 
it from the following variations:

The single-source shortest path problem, in which we have to find shortest paths from a source 
vertex v to all other vertices in the graph.
The single-destination shortest path problem, in which we have to find shortest paths from all 
vertices in the directed graph to a single destination vertex v. This can be reduced to the 
single-source shortest path problem by reversing the arcs in the directed graph.
The all-pairs shortest path problem, in which we have to find shortest paths between every pair 
of vertices v, v' in the graph.
These generalizations have significantly more efficient algorithms than the simplistic approach 
of running a single-pair shortest path algorithm on all relevant pairs of vertices.

/*
Quciksort is an unstable algorithm, it takes O(nlog(n)) comparisons and in the worst case it makes O(n^2) comparisons.
Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm.
The steps are:
1.Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array.
2.Partitioning: reorder the array so that all elements that are bigger than pivot come to pivot right, and all elements 
that are smaller than pivot come to pivot left. After this partitioning, this pivot won't change its position and we get two sub-arrays.
3.Recursively apply the above steps to the left sub-array and right sub-array until size of array is zero ot one.
